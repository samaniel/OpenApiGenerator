# OpenApi with WebClient Demo

This is a demo using ApiFirst methodology, openapi-generator and a connection with webclient.


# Usage
Compile the project using maven prior to running it, so openapi-generator can do its magic.


# Notes
Remember that a working endpoint in an external service is required.
